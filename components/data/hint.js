                    Theodore Robert Bundy (1946/11/24 - 1989/01/24, aka Ted Bundy) was an American serial killer who kidnapped, raped, and murdered numerous young women and girls during the 1970s and possibly earlier. 
                    After more than a decade of denials, he confessed to thirty murders he committed in seven states between 1974 and 1978. 
                    Bundy's true victim total is unknown, and is likely significantly higher.

                    Bundy was regarded as charismatic and handsome, traits that he exploited to win the trust of both his victims and society as a whole. 
                    He would typically approach his victims in public places, either feigning a physical impairment such as an injury, or impersonating an authority figure, before bludgeoning them into unconsciousness and taking them to secondary locations to be raped and strangled. 
                    Bundy often revisited his victims, grooming and performing sexual acts with the corpses. 
                    He decapitated at least twelve victims and kept their severed heads as mementos in his apartment. 
                    On a few occasions, he broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.

                    In 1975, Bundy was arrested and jailed in Utah. 
                    He then became a suspect in a progressively longer list of unsolved homicides in several states. 
                    Facing murder charges in Colorado, he engineered two dramatic escapes and committed further assaults in Florida before his ultimate recapture in 1978. 
                    For the Florida homicides, he received three death sentences in two trials. 
                    Bundy was executed at Florida State Prison in Raiford on January 24, 1989.

                    David Richard Berkowitz (born 1953/6/1, aka the Son of Sam and .44 Caliber Killer) is an American serial killer who pleaded guilty to eight shootings that began in New York City on 1976/7/29.

                    Berkowitz served in the US Army and quitted the army in '74. 
                    Using a .44 Special caliber Bulldog revolver, he killed six people and wounded seven others by July 1977. 
                    Berkowitz eluded the biggest police manhunt in the history of New York City while leaving letters that mocked the police and promised further crimes, which were highly publicized by the press.

                    Berkowitz was arrested on 1977/8/10, and subsequently indicted for eight shootings. 
                    He confessed to all of them, and initially claimed to have been obeying the orders of a demon manifested in the form of a dog belonging to his neighbor "Sam". 
                    He subsequently admitted that the dog-and-devil story was a hoax. 
                    In the course of further police investigations, Berkowitz was also implicated in many unsolved arsons in the city.
                                    
                    During the mid-1990s, he amended his confession to claim that he had been a member of a violent Satanic cult that orchestrated the incidents as ritual murder. 
                    A new investigation of the murders began in 1996, but was suspended indefinitely after inconclusive findings.

                    Theodore John Kaczynski (born 1942/5/22, aka the Unabomber), is an American domestic terrorist and former mathematics professor. 
                    He was a mathematics prodigy, but abandoned his academic career in 1969 to pursue a primitive life.

                    In 1971, Kaczynski moved to a remote cabin without electricity or running water near Lincoln and became self-sufficient. 
                    He witnessed the destruction of the wilderness surrounding his cabin, then resolved to fight industrialization and its destruction of nature through terrorism.
                    
                    Between 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski killed three people and injured 23 others in a nationwide bombing campaign against people he believed to be advancing modern technology and the destruction of the environment. 
                    In 1995, he sent a letter to The New York Times promising to "desist from terrorism" if the Times or The Washington Post published his essay, Industrial Society and Its Future.
                    
                    The FBI used the case identifier UNABOM (University and Airline Bomber) before his identity was known, which resulted in the media naming him the "Unabomber". 
                    The FBI and Attorney General pushed for the publication of Industrial Society and Its Future, which appeared in The Washington Post in September 1995. 
                    Upon reading the essay, Kaczynski's brother, David, recognized the prose style and reported his suspicions to the FBI. 
                    
                    Kaczynski was arrested in 1996, a plea bargain was reached under which he pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to eight consecutive life terms in prison without the possibility of parole.

                    Dennis Lynn Rader (born 1945/3/9, aka the BTK killer or strangler) is an American serial killer who murdered at least ten people in 1974 - 1991. 
                    The name BTK, which stands for Bind, Torture, and Kill, an apt description of his modus operandi. 
                    Letters were written soon after the killings to police and to local news outlets, boasting of the crimes and knowledge of details. 
                    After a long hiatus, these letters resumed in 2004.

                    Rader would wander the city until he found a potential victim. 
                    At that point, he would stalk the person until he knew the pattern of their lives and when would be the best time to strike. 
                    At the time of the murder, Rader would break into the house, cut the phone lines, and hide until his victim came home.
                    
                    Rader would strangle his victims until they lost consciousness, then let them revive, then strangle them again. 
                    He would repeat the pattern over and over again, finally strangle them to death and masturbate to ejaculation onto the corpse.
                    
                    On 2005/2/25, Rader was detained near his home and accused of the BTK killings. 
                    Rader pled guilty to his crimes on 2005/6/27, giving a graphic, almost surreal account of his crimes in court. 
                    He was sentenced to serve ten consecutive life sentences, without possibility of parole for 175 years on 2005/8/18.
